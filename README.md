# Navier_Stokes
This repository contains scripts for Navier_Stokes fluid dynamics. As of 12/5/2020, the scripts are my working versions for the Navier-Stokes equations, which have been pulled from the below sources. My hope is to develop my own novel code, but for the time being I am working with Branden and Lorena's code to learn more about the problem. I marked two folders, which contain published scripts from the respective authors. In the event I develop novel code, I will create a seperate folder.

Dependicies for this respository are: numpy, matplot, sympy, and ffmpeg*
